      <h2>Labore et Constantia</h2>
      <p><strong>Christophe Plantin</strong> was a French Renaissance humanist and a renowned book printer and
        publisher. He established one of
        the most influential publishing houses of his time in Antwerp, transforming the city into a leading center of
        European
        book production.</p>
      <p>Plantin's legacy extends far beyond his impressive body of work. His printing house, the Plantin Press,
        continued to
        operate for generations, and today, the <strong>Plantin-Moretus Museum</strong> in Antwerp, a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site, stands as a
        testament to his enduring contribution to the world of printing and publishing.</p>

      <h2>The Art of Typography</h2>
      <p>Plantin championed the use of high-quality typefaces, recognizing their crucial role in enhancing readability
        and the
        overall aesthetic appeal of his books. He drew inspiration from classical Roman inscriptions and Renaissance
        humanism,
        striving for typefaces that were both elegant and legible.</p>
      <article class="typing_quest">
        <h3>Typing Quest:</h3>
        <p>Try to guess and type the name of the group of typefaces which named for sixteenth-century engraver. Plantin
          used it in
          his production of famous Polyglot Bible.

          Tip: Use colourful punches</p>

      <article class="garamond">
        <h3>And the answer is...</h3>
        <p>Plantin invested heavily in the creation of new typefaces. Skilled artisans, called punchcutters,
          meticulously carved
          the shape of each letter into a steel punch. This punch was then used to create a matrix, which served as the
          mold for
          casting individual letters of type. The Plantin Polyglot Bible, with its multiple languages (Hebrew, Greek,
          Latin, and
          Aramaic), demanded a diverse range of typefaces.

          For this ambitious project, Plantin collaborated with renowned French type designer <strong>Claude
            Garamond</strong>. Garamond provided
          the steel punches for many of the characters used in the Bible, ensuring the highest quality and aesthetic
          standards for
          this monumental work.</p>

      <h2>A Master of Craftsmanship</h2>
      <p>Plantin was celebrated for his meticulous attention to detail, producing books of exceptional quality with
        exquisite
        typography, careful editing, and stunning illustrations. He employed some of the most talented artists of his
        time,
        including the renowned engraver, <strong>Johannes Wierix</strong>.</p>
      <p>Wierix brought a new level of artistry to Plantin's books. His engravings were characterized by intricate
        detail,
        dynamic composition, and expressive power. He mastered the technique of copper engraving, which involved
        carefully
        carving intricate patterns into metal plates.</p>
      <article class="engraving_techniques">
        <h3>Engraving techniques</h3>
        <p>Engraver made his images using an impression on paper (in a mirror form) from a printing plate — a "board"
          made of metal
          with an in-depth (engraved) pattern applied to such a form. With a hardened steel tool called a drill or
          engraver to
          carve a pattern on a surface.</p>
        <p>The greatest merit of his publishing house is also the use of <strong>copper engravings</strong> and the
          spread of this method in Holland
          and other European countries.</p>
        <p>In Italy, copper engraving has been known since the 50s of the XVI century. But Plantin's prints were better:
          featuring
          Wierix's engravings, became <strong>renowned for their high quality</strong> and artistic merit, contributing
          to the spread of this
          technique throughout Europe.</p>

      <article class="woodblocks">
        <h3>Woodblocks</h3>
        <p>In contrast to copper engraving, <strong>woodcut</strong> involves applying contours and strokes with ink,
          and then cutting off each
          stroke on both sides to a depth of 2-8 mm with a knife. In between, the wood was selected with a chisel.
          Woodcuts were
          typically created on blocks of softer woods like pear or linden, with the grain direction often influencing
          the
          direction of the lines. After carving, the board was rolled up with paint and the impression was transferred
          to paper. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Plantin-Moretus Museum</strong> has an extraordinary collection of 14,000 woodblocks. 14,000
          examples of true craftmanship,
          drawings masterly cut in wood.</p>
